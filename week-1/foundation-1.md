machine learning deals with mathematical expressions.
it is divided into two main types-
1) supervised learning(SL)- present data in this are labeled, organized, and mainly target numerical data types(continuous and discrete). eg. Email Spam Classification
2) unsupervised learning(UL) - data available for this are not organized. eg. customer's purchasing behavior.


 We find the relationship, and pattern between data by using different processes.

 classification, regression(SL)
 dimensionality reduction, density reduction(UL)
